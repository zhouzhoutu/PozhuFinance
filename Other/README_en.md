## Repository Introduction

When learning investment-related knowledge on the Pozhu APP, this repository will synchronously share information such as notes and materials.

## About Pozhu
[Pozhu](https://pc.pozhu.com) is a domestic vertical financial education platform that brings together well-known influencers in the industry to give lectures, such as Wu Xiaoping and Guan Qingyou. These instructors have much more substantial qualifications compared to bloggers on other internet platforms who talk about financial investments. The content of their lectures also covers various aspects of the financial field.

I've noticed that the [Overseas version of Pozhu](https://www.pozhu.app) is also in the planning and construction phase. It will provide more customized content and services for overseas Chinese, which is worth looking forward to.

I've always believed that a person's physical strength declines with age. In today's rapidly developing society, besides relying on physical strength to earn money, learning to make money with money is a skill that everyone should acquire. Unfortunately, in Chinese cultural habits, talking about money is still something people are shy about.

Compared to the haphazard approach of randomly reading news and listening to tidbits of information, systematic course learning with reliable instructors will surely help one avoid unnecessary detours.
I hope that the content updated here can not only improve my skills in financial investment but also facilitate my future review and summary.
